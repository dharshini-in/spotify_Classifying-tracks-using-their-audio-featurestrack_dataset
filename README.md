## Project Title: Genre Classification of Spotify Tracks Using Audio Features
## Aim:
To classify Spotify tracks spanning 125 diverse genres based on their audio characteristics using machine learning techniques.

## Procedure:

Data Collection and Loading:

Load the dataset of Spotify tracks presented in CSV format.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and remove duplicates.
Convert and clean categorical data such as artists and album names.
Process numerical features to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Feature Engineering:

Extract relevant features such as track_id, artists, album_name, track_name, popularity, duration_ms, explicit, danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, time_signature, and track_genre.
Create additional features if needed to improve model performance.
Scaling and Normalization:

Normalize and scale the data to standardize the range of independent variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Use visualizations like heatmaps to understand correlations between features.
Analyze the distribution of various audio features across different genres.
Dimensionality Reduction:

Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the feature space while retaining essential information.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Train multiple machine learning classification models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, KNN) on the processed dataset.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Compare the performance of different models to identify the best-performing one.
## Tools Required:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook or any other IDE for development
## Summary:
Developed a machine learning model to classify Spotify tracks into 125 genres based on their audio features. The project involved extensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and scaling. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used for dimensionality reduction, followed by training and evaluating various classification models. Visualization techniques such as heatmaps were employed for exploratory data analysis. The best-performing model was identified and compared against others to ensure optimal classification performance.
